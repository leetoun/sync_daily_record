Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems, providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function as an NT4-style domain controller, and can integrate with both NT4 domains and Active Directory realms as a member server.
